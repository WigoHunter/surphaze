# surphaze
[Previously known as Outwerspace]
Surphaze is an open source project built on Meteor.js, React.js and Redux. It's basically a map version of LinkedIn on which users will be able to connect with VCs/Developers/Designers and all sort of makers in their neighborhoods.

## Story behind Surphaze
I came up with this idea when I was travelling in SF and NY earlier this year. When I booked an apartment on airbnb, this idea just popped into my mind - That would be really great if I can somehow get to know and grab a drink with some tech people in the area. I mean, it is Silicon Valley!

And now it's launched in early beta. Let me know if you are interested in joining the beta and play with some minor bugs :)

My email address is kh736@cornell.edu

I will include the list of features available in this beta, as well as another list of features I plan to roll out in the future. However, please do expect a while before those incoming features to come alive soon. I am starting a semester at Cornell Tech on August 24th and will be looking for a software engineering internship in the summer 2019 (targeting Facebook/Google/Twitter/LinkedIn). So if you want to speed up the development of this project, you can also hire me at the same email address (kh736@cornell.edu) :p
